# Lesson 3

```{r include = F}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}

g <- function(x){
  exp(x^2)
}

#create sample from uniform distribution
sample <- runif(10000)
sample.length <- length(sample)

mean(sapply(sample,g))
mean(g(sample))



```


### Estimating pi
```{r}


g <- function(x){
  sqrt(1-x^2)
}

#create sample from uniform distribution
sample <- runif(100000000)

mean(g(sample))*4


gIndicatriz <- function(x,y){
  ifelse((x^2 + y^2) <= 1, 1, 0)
}

sampleX <- runif(1000000)
sampleY <- runif(1000000)
mean(gIndicatriz(sampleX,sampleY))*4


```

## Hypothesis Testing

A statistical hypothesis is some conjecture about the distribution of one or more random variables. 
For each hypothesis designated by null hypothesis and denoted by $H0$, there is always an alternative hypothesis denoted by $H1$.
We start the test by believing that $H0$ is true, and during the test we can discard that hypothesis only if the data points there.

Moreover, we can see these hypothesis testing as:

- A statistical hypothesis is some statement about the parameters of one or more populations (parametric tests) or about the distribution of the population (non-parametric tests).
- The goal of a test is to use the information of a data sample to decide (reject or no reject) about a conjecture over unknown aspects of a given population.

### Types of error while infering through hypothesis testing

There are always some risk associated to statistical inference:

- *** Type 1 error ***: reject $H0$ when $H0$ is true (rejecting error, aka False Negative in ML nomenclature)
- *** Type 2 error ***: accept $H0$ when $H0$ is false (no rejecting error, aka False Positive in ML nomenclature)

### Defining $\alpha$ to reduce a type of error

$$
\alpha = P(Type1Err) = P(Rejecting H0 | H0 is true)
$$ 

So, we define $\alpha$ as being the probability that we want for the Type 1 error - or how much are we willing to be prone to this type of error.

Therefone, $\alpha$ is called *** significance level *** of the test (a test that is very prone to errors is not very significant, right?)

In general, we assign a very small value to the probability of type I error (0.05 ou 0.01).

On the other end of the error spectrum, we define $\beta$ as

$$
\beta = P(Type2Err) = P(Accepting H0 | H0 is false)
$$ 

where $1 − \beta$ is called power of the test. The insight here is that the lower the $\beta$, the more "power" this test have.

### Procedure to make a test using $p-value$

#### Wait, what is p-value?

### Estimating test stats

The hypothesis being tested is the following:

We have a sample (the variable `popSample` below) of independent observations from a random variable that we know follows an exponencial distribution, with unknown parameter $\lambda$.

We want to test if $\lambda = 3$.

```{r}
popSample <- c(0.2,1.2,2.9,1.2,0.1,0.1,0.4,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.9,0.3,0.6,0.1,0.2,0.1,0.4,0.1,0.3,1.4)

lambdaEstimator <- function(sample){
  1/mean(sample)
}


parameter <- 3

testStatsEstimator <- function(sample,hypothesisLambda, estimatedLambda){
  sampleMean <- mean(sample)
  sampleLength <- length(sample)
  return(
    (
      1/((sampleMean*hypothesisLambda)^sampleLength))
        *
      (exp(
        sampleLength*
        (
          hypothesisLambda*sampleMean -1)
        )
     )
  )
}

tobs <- testStatsEstimator(popSample,parameter,lambdaEstimator(popSample))
```

Here, we will do the following 1000 times:

- we get a random sample from an exponential with $\lambda$ = 3
- we obtain the estimated test statistic for this sample
 
By the end of this process, we will get 1000 values that represente possible values of the Test Statistic Function


```{r warning=F}
empiricDistTestStats <- sapply(1:1000,function(idx){
  sampleTest <- rexp(length(popSample),parameter)
  testStatsEstimator(sampleTest,parameter,lambdaEstimator(sampleTest))
}) 

empiricDistTestStats <- c(empiricDistTestStats,tobs)
empiricDistTestStats.df <- as.data.frame(empiricDistTestStats)
names(empiricDistTestStats.df) <- c("values")

empiricFrequency <- empiricDistTestStats.df %>% dplyr::group_by(values) %>% dplyr::summarise(n=n())

p_value_estimated <- sum(empiricFrequency[empiricFrequency$values >= tobs,]$n)/sum(empiricFrequency$n)


a <- list(
  text = paste0("P value estimated: " , round(p_value_estimated,5)),
  x = tobs,
  y = 0.3,
  xref = "x",
  yref = "y",
  ax = 50
)

plotly::plot_ly(
  x = empiricDistTestStats
  , type="histogram"
  , histnorm = "probability"
  , name = "Empiric Frequency") %>% 
plotly::add_segments(
  x = tobs, xend = tobs, y = 0, yend = 0.3, name = "T obs"
) %>% plotly::layout(annotations=a)

```
